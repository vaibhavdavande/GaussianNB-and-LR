# GaussianNB-and-LR
Lets do some machine learning algorithm 
Here i have used the titanic dataset from seaborn library, in which I have used suvrived as an output and age, sex, fare and parch as an input attributes.
Based on the input attributes and Output I have trained the GaussianNB Naive Bayes algorithm. I have got training accuracy as 78% and prediction accuracy as 81.56%
Further more I have used the LogisticRegression algorithm to cross validate the performance the GaussianNB with LR. Through this it is been obsereved that, the accuracy of both the algorithm is nearly same.
